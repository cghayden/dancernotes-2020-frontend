## What is Dancernotes?

Dancernotes is an information management application for dance parents, and a content management system for dance studios
DN helps parents keep track of all of their dancer's classes, apparel requirements, costume requirements, music, choreography, rehearsals, events, and more.
Parents can enter their own information or subscribe to particpating studios to have access to real time information from the studios, and to enroll in classes.

Parents can manage multiple dancers and studios in one place

The idea for thisd app came from my own experiences as a dance parent. My children are involved in many dances and performances across several different studios.  Each dance routine has its own costume requirements, music, and choreograpy videos, all of which were communicated to me via text and email.  Anytime I needed information on a dance, I would have to search through my emails and texts to find what I was looking for.  I realized how helpful it would be if all of this information could be found in one place, and dancernotes was born.

Dancernotes reduces confusion and mistakes over costumes and schedules, by ensuring that parents always have the information they need right at their fingertips.  This facilitates better dance teams and happier clients of dance studios.

Dancernotes eases communication from dance studios to parents, studios to communicate costumes, music, choreography, and scheduling all in one place, by simply updating the dance's information from their phone or computer, whether they are at home or at the office.
